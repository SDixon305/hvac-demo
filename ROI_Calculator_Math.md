# ROI Calculator Math Explained

This document breaks down the logic used to calculate the "Current Reality" vs. the "AI Scenario".

## 1. The Basics
First, we determine the volume of calls and split them into two buckets: **Emergencies** and **Standard Service Calls**.

*   **Weeks per Month**: 4.33
*   **Monthly Call Volume** = `Weekly Missed Calls` × 4.33
*   **Monthly Emergencies** = `Monthly Call Volume` × `Emergency %`
*   **Monthly Standard Calls** = `Monthly Call Volume` - `Monthly Emergencies`

## 2. Current Reality (The "Before" State)
How much money are you making right now from these after-hours calls? This depends heavily on your current provider (Voicemail vs. Answering Service).

### A. Revenue from Emergencies
*   **Logic**: Emergencies need immediate attention. If you don't answer or get patched through immediately, you lose the job.
*   **Formula**: `Monthly Emergencies` × `Current Emergency Capture Rate` × `Avg Emergency Revenue`
    *   *Note*: "Current Emergency Capture Rate" varies by provider.
        *   *Voicemail*: Very low (~5%). Most people hang up.
        *   *Answering Service*: High (~90%). They answer and patch you through.

### B. Revenue from Standard Calls
*   **Logic**: These are non-urgent (e.g., maintenance). If missed, you have to call them back the next day. Many will have already found someone else.
*   **Formula**: `Monthly Standard Calls` × `Callback Booking Rate` × `Avg Standard Revenue`
    *   *Note*: "Callback Booking Rate" is usually low (~15-30%) because of "phone tag" and competitors.

### **Total Current Revenue** = (A) + (B)

## 3. AI Scenario (The "After" State)
How much money *could* you make if an AI Agent answered instantly, booked the job, or dispatched the tech?

### A. Revenue from Emergencies (with AI)
*   **Logic**: AI answers instantly. It filters out false alarms and dispatches valid emergencies immediately.
*   **Formula**: `Monthly Emergencies` × `AI Capture Rate` × `AI Emergency Booking Rate` × `Avg Emergency Revenue`

### B. Revenue from Standard Calls (with AI)
*   **Logic**: AI answers instantly and books the appointment directly on your calendar. No phone tag.
*   **Formula**: `Monthly Standard Calls` × `AI Capture Rate` × `AI Next-Day Booking Rate` × `Avg Standard Revenue`

### **Total AI Revenue** = (A) + (B)

---

## 4. The Bottom Line (ROI)

### Monthly Revenue Recovered
This is the extra cash generated by the AI.
*   **Formula**: `Total AI Revenue` - `Total Current Revenue`

### Monthly Net Gain
This accounts for the cost savings of firing your old provider and the cost of the AI.
*   **Formula**: `Monthly Revenue Recovered` + `Old Provider Cost` - `AI Cost`
